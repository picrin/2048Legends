Dear Internet Explorer user. Your browser probably sucks and Microsoft is evil. As a programmer and a human being I refuse to support you. Download yourself a version of <a href="http://firefox.com">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a>. Or if you really insist to remain in sin (but remember that it's never too late to seek remission), at least install the latest version of your <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/internet-explorer/download-ie">God's Forbidden Browser</a>. You might want to remember to untick "Bing and MSN defaults", unless you like to google with bing.
