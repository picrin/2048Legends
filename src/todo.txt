Things to do:
  
  * rename/change url path for callbacks
D * get rid of the global variables in views that contain stuff like our web address, wallet id, etc.
  * make variable names consistent (eg. plays, gamesRemaining, etc.)
  * change what happens when a payment is processed that does not have an associated transaction
    database entry. Currently we simply print an error message and quit. this should not happen.
    we should record the occurence of the payment, credit the user's account with more plays regardless,
    and notify them by email.
  * create some html/css/javascript frontend for the payment system
  * make sure the current system is compatible with special offers/packs
